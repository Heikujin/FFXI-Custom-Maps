# FFXI-Custom-Maps
A collection of FFXI maps that I've customized to include more information and/or upscaled if an HD version wasn't already available.  For maps I did not create from scratch, credit goes to the [Remapster](https://remapster.com/) team for their amazing HD maps.  I've separated maps into their own folders so that you can choose what you'd like to use.  

### henm-maps
These maps are custom to the HorizonXI server to show the '???' locations of their custom HENM content.
### sky-hd-maps
The interior Sky maps have not been remastered yet so I upscaled them and redrew all the custom stuff from Drauku's [Vision](https://github.com/Drauku/FFXI-Vision) maps.

## Installation
### Preferred Method:
Download your preferred map pack by clicking on the green 'Code' button and then clicking 'Download zip'.  Extract the zip and then move the map folder into your [XIPivot](https://github.com/Shirk/XIPivot) `DATs` folder and then load it above other map dats you might have in game.  Be sure not the move the folder that ends in "-main".  Open that folder and move If using Ashita, you can automatically load these by adding `/pivot add skyhdmaps` to `./scripts/default.txt`.

### Manual Method:
Copy `ROM` folder to your `./FINAL FANTASY XI` directory and choose "Yes" when prompted to overwrite.
