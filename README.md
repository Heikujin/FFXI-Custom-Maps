# FFXI-Custom-Maps
A collection of FFXI maps that I've customized to include more information and/or upscaled if an HD version wasn't already available.  For maps I did not create from scratch, credit goes to the [Remapster](https://remapster.com/) team for their amazing HD maps.  I've separated maps into their own folders so that you can choose what you'd like to use.  

### henm-maps:
These maps are custom to the HorizonXI server to show the `???` locations of their custom HENM content.
### sky-hd-maps:
The interior Sky maps have not been remastered yet so I upscaled them and redrew all the custom stuff from Drauku's [Vision](https://github.com/Drauku/FFXI-Vision) maps.

## Installation
### Preferred Method:
Download the map pack by clicking on the green `Code` button and then click `Download zip`.  Open up the `FFXI-Custom-Maps-main` folder and then move the map folder within into your [XIPivot](https://github.com/Shirk/XIPivot) `DATs` folder.  If using the HorizonXI launcher, navigate to `Settings` and then `Pivot` and enable the map DAT.  If using Ashita standalone, you can automatically load these by adding `/pivot add [map name]` to `./scripts/default.txt`.  Once in game type `/pivot` and be sure the map dat is loaded above any other maps dats you might have.

### Manual Method:
Copy `ROM` folder to your `./FINAL FANTASY XI` directory and choose "Yes" when prompted to overwrite.
